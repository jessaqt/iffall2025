	<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong><br>
			Jessica Chen, Computer Science + Math, Junior<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong><br>
			I have experience in fullstack development. I took CSE 330S last semester which focused more heavily on backend, so I wanted to take a course for front-end design. 
            I am also taking this to fulfil my Engineering Humanity requirement.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong><br>
			Yes, I have some past experience. I've designed websites for class work and personal projects, and I worked on a UI team this summer for my internship.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong><br>
			I want to strengthen my design skills and learn how to better apply effective and interactive design.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong><br>
			One main difference I think of is how screens are interactive and need to be adaptable. 
            For example, there's clickable elements, scrolling, and responsiveness across different screen sizes/devices.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong><br>
			I think <a href="https://www.dopplepress.com/" target="_blank">Dopplepress</a> is an example of effective design. 
            The website uses creative design features such as changing the user's cursor to match the theme of the site. It also resizes well when I change my screen size.
            There are animations, interactive portions such as dragging and dropping color blocks, and a very cohesive aesthetic across the site.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong><br>
			I think <a href="https://www.sasaki.com/" target="_blank">Sasaki</a> exemplifies effective communication.
            The home page is clean and minimalistic, displaying the logo, goal, and navigation in the top right corner, giving users a streamlined experience.
            <br><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong><br>
			I think <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> works well. The website allows users to quickly search up products and find what they need efficiently with filters.
            Users receive personalized product recommendations, and checkout is streamlined. <br><br>
