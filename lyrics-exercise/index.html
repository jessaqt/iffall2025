      You don't need me
      As much as I need you
      As much as I need you
      Take it or leave it
      'Cause you know that's the truth
      'Cause you know that's the truth

      <span class="lyric-tag">[Chorus]</span>
      I know you thought it was just us
      I didn't think you'd fall in love
      You're just a warm body to hold
      At night when I'm feeling all alone

      <span class="lyric-tag">[Post-Chorus]</span>
      I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I didn't mean that, that thing I said last night, it was)
      I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I don't know what happened)
      I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I have this thing where I, I can't really be by myself)
      I don't want to, yeah, yeah (But look)

      <span class="lyric-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
      Called you for the last time
      I need to be with you
      I need to be with you
      Saw you in a dream last night
      You looked like a ghost
      You looked like a ghost
